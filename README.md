# Important preparation-info for the course:

## Software

It is important to prepare your laptop, computer, or remote server in order to be able to participate in the hands-on part of the course. Here a few comments about this:

- It is better if you have a Unix system on your computer (Linux, MacOS).  Windows is OK as long as you can run Python in it, and solve eventual problems with it.
- Install the following packages, if possible in the indicated versions when shown:
  - pystan:                    3.10.0
  - arviz:                     0.19.0
  - nest-asyncio               1.6.0
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - mpltern
  - ternary
  
- The above packages work correctly -at least- in ``Python 3.10.14``.  You can use ``conda`` to amulate an environment in which you install Python in any specific version, and then install the above packages in the indicated versions.

## Hardware

- Any normal laptop is OK.  In the 5th lecture your laptop may feel better if you have a server where to run the Python notebooks, but don worry if you don't have it, we adapt the notebooks.

## Readings

- It would be better if you have some knowledge about the following distributions:
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Normal or Gaussian</a> (of course that you know this one!)
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">Bernoulli or Binomial</a>
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson</a>
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution">Multinomial</a>
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">Exponential</a>
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution">Dirichlet</a> (this is important, and conceptully difficult)

- A nice introductory paper for the course could be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808">Bayesian Workflow</a>
- Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/sequi76/BML/blob/main/bibliography.md">proposed bibliography</a>
